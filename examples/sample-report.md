This video showcases Toolio, a Python-based automated Nmap reporting tool I developed.

In the demo, I run a simple scan against scanme.nmap.org using Toolioâ€™s command-line interface. The tool performs the scan, parses the results, and automatically generates clean, human-readable reports in HTML, JSON, and Markdown formats.

The video highlights Toolioâ€™s:

Efficient command-line workflow

Automatic parallel scanning and structured data parsing

Professionally formatted reports suitable for documentation or analysis

This demonstration provides a quick look at how Toolio streamlines network reconnaissance reporting for security professionals and enthusiasts alike.
